# Reverse Engineering

Welcome to the Reverse Engineering (RE) Dojo
In this course, you will embark on a journey into the world of Reverse Engineering, one crucial aspect in Cyber Security.

What is Reverse Engineering?
Reverse Engineering is the process of analyzing a product, software, or system to understand its inner workings, design, and functionality. The goal is to decontrust the item back to the basic components to see how it was built and operates.

What Will You Learn?
Throughout this course, we will cover the fundamental concepts of Reverse Engineering, including:

Cryptographic Code Analysis:
- Cryptographic Code Analysis focuses more on finding encrypted strings while looking through blocks of code. Locating encrypted or obfuscated strings in the code, whether they are hardcoded or dynamimcally generated.

Malware Analysis:
- Malware analysis is the process of examining malicious software to understand its behavior, functionality, and impact. It involes decompiling the malware either statically or dynamically to identify its origin, purpose and techniques.
  - Static Analysis is examining code without executing the malicious code or software.
  - Dynamic Analysis is observing the behavior during execution.

Vulnerability Analysis:
- Vulnerability Analysis is the process of identifying, classifying, and evaluating a security weakness in a system, network, or application.

Get ready to unleash your creativity and problem-solving skills as we dive into the exciting world of Reverse Engineering. Letâ€™s begin our adventure in the Reverse Engineering Dojo!
